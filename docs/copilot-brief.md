# Copilot Brief

## Coding standards

- JavaScript/TypeScript: double quotation marks; end statements with semicolons.
- ESLint + Prettier + Airbnb config; fix on save.
- React: hooks, no CRA; prefer Vite/Next when needed.

## Text style

- British English; no Oxford comma.
- Use “In addition” over “Additionally”.
- Spell out one to ten; numerals above 10.

## Project guardrails

- Follow the repo’s TODO.md as source of truth.
- Write/adjust tests with any code change.
- Prefer small PRs; reference issues in commits (e.g., “fix: … (closes #42)”).
